Code Detector

Code Detector is a project that identifies whether a piece of code is AI-generated or human-written.  
It’s built and tested using Google Colab, focusing on logic clarity and detection accuracy.

Features
- Detects AI-written vs. human-written code
- Trained and tested on multiple code examples
- Clean and readable implementation in Python

File Info
- **CodeDetector.ipynb** – main notebook containing the entire project
 
Usage
Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to run and modify the code.


Developed as a personal research project named *Code Detector* – exploring the boundary between human logic and AI patterns.
